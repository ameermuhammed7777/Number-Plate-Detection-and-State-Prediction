#Number Plate Detection and State Prediction

This project focuses on the detection of vehicle number plates from input images. It involves preprocessing the images by applying a threshold to improve the visibility of the number plate. The text on the number plate is then extracted using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool, PyTesseract. Finally, the extracted text is analyzed to predict the state to which the vehicle belongs, providing a comprehensive solution for number plate recognition and state identification.
